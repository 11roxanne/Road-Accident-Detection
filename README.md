# Road-Accident-Detection

# Overview

The Accident Detection System is a sophisticated computer vision project that utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect accidents in real-time. By processing video frames, the system can accurately predict accidents and promptly trigger notifications, ensuring a timely response.

# Features

Real-time Accident Detection: Leverages a pre-trained CNN to analyze video frames and detect accidents as they happen.

Notification System: Sends SMS notifications via the Twilio API upon detecting an accident, ensuring immediate alerting.

# Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow, Keras: For building and deploying the pre-trained CNN model.

OpenCV: For video frame processing and real-time video feed handling.

Twilio API: For sending SMS notifications.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.
